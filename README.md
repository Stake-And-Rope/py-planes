## About :bookmark_tabs:

Py-Planes is a Python written offline game where the player takes the control of a airplane and fight against enemies. The game consists of two separate components -> Launcher (Main Menu) written in Qt Framework and the game itself made with PyGame. 

The Launcher is made with few different files, the logic is separated and there are relations between the files managing the execution of the specific menu, based on the player's actions. 

The PyGame files are running the game itself, initializing the levels, the players, the enemies and the surrounding objects. 

Py-Planes is executed as one game, but in the back-end are actually two separated applications running simultaneously and communicating one with another. 

The user and game settings are stored in a JSON files which contents are being read and submitted to specific object in the front-end. The settings are also used for the PyGame logic giving the user's plane specific abilities as damage, health, armor, etc. and setting the game fps.
